    <p class="text_container">I went to The Equity Project for middle school. It was a charter school, who's main purpose was to provide the best education and facilaties for minorities. This school taught me a lot about my own culture and what it means to be a minority</p>
    <p class="text_container">The current Highschool that I attend is Bronx Science, a specialized school in New York city that focuses on STEM. This is the very first place where i was able to surround myself with people who had the same aspirations that i had, people aiming to be more in this world. </p>
