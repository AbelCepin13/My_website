    <p id="text_container">The picture above is my dad's side of the family. On this side i have a lot of family members, reaching numbers of possibly past a hundred. This is the family that I've been apart of for essentially my whole life, we would always have reunions where we would just hang out and enjoy each other's company. The relationships i have with my cousins are unmatched.</p>
    <p id="text_container">My Dad and his family grew up in the mountains for most of their youth, in a small home with only two bedrooms. He had to live in the small home with his other 13 siblings. They all had to learn how to become independent as they knew their parents couldn't take care of all of them. They moved to moca by the time my dad was 20 and they became a household name in the city. Many people have respected my family due to their success in supermarkets and even met the president of the country. </p>
