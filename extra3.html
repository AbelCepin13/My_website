    <p id="text_container">I first learned how finances worked with my dad at his store as he worked in produce and would have me tag along evertime he'd go to the store. There he taught me what it meant to have a buisness and how one would manage the finances of a store. </p>
    <p id="text_container">My father is a buisness owner so ever since I was little I've always watched him manage all the finances of his store and been inetrested with the numbers on the paper. As i got older he taught me more and more about finances and now i currently am applying to multiple Finance programs. </p>
