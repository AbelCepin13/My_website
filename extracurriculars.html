    <p id="text_container">One of my more major extracurricular is basketball. For the last two years of highschool I've been on the school's basketball team and have been of the captain of the team aswell. Being on the team taught me a lot on what it means to be a leader that's able to keep other's motivated and at 100% at all times. I cherish my expirence as a captain.</p>
    <p id="text_container">Coding and programming have been a huge extracurricular for me as it's essentially what i want to pursue in the future. I have been apart of multiple hackathons and also this program. I'd like to say that i take programming very seriously and ty to learn as much as possible.</p>
    <p id="text_container">My father is a buisness owner so ever since I was little I've always watched him manage all the finances of his store and been inetrested with the numbers on the paper. As i got older he taught me more and more about finances and now i currently am applying to multiple Finance programs. </p>
