    <p class="text_container">The picture above is a family photo of my mom's side of the family(Ecudorian). This part of the family all reside in Long Island so im able to see them quite often since i just need to take the LIRR to get there. The time I spent with them really allowed me to connect more to my Ecudorian roots as i spent the majority of my life spending time more with my dominican side,But luckily I've interacted a lot more with my mom's family the last two years. I've been very grateful foe theit support and overall care that they've shown me.</p>
    <p class="text_container">The picture above is my dad's side of the family. On this side i have a lot of family members, reaching numbers of possibly past a hundred. This is the family that I've been apart of for essentially my whole life, we would always have reunions where we would just hang out and enjoy each other's company. The relationships i have with my cousins are unmatched.</p>
