    <p class="text_container">My first major achivement was being the valedictorian of my middle school. It was a very proud moment for me because i had worked extremely hard for all three years of middle school, so being named valedictorian was a dream come true. More than the reward itswlf, the speech i gave really made the achievment much more satisfying. </p>
    <p class="text_container">A more recent achivement is me winning first place at my school's annual Hack-a-thon with a friend of mine. This experience single handedly changed my future as it was what allowed me to realize my passion for computer science and programming. That day I spent hours learning while coding, trying my hardest to at least get a program working. When hearing the announcment of me an my friend winning first, i felt pure joy as i was proudly able to say that I am a programmer. </p>
